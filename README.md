## ‚ú® Features

Color Master is packed with features designed for both beginners and power-users, giving you ultimate control over your workspace's appearance.

#### üèõÔ∏è Foundational Features
* **Live Color Editor**: An intuitive UI with color pickers and text inputs to see your changes instantly.
* **Full Profile Management**: Create, delete, and switch between multiple color profiles. Each profile can have its own colors, snippets, and theme settings.
* **Bilingual Interface**: Full support for both English and Arabic (ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©), with automatic Right-to-Left (RTL) mode.
* **Beautiful Default Themes**: Comes with five stunning, ready-to-use profiles to get you started.

#### üöÄ Power-User Tools
* **NEW - Per-Profile CSS Snippets!**: The "Paste CSS" feature has evolved! Snippets are **no longer global** and are now saved directly to the active profile. This means your small CSS tweaks are perfectly organized and are **exported automatically** with your theme.
* **NEW - Powerful Import/Export**:
    * **Create New Profile from JSON**: Easily import a `.json` file to create a brand new profile instantly, without needing to create an empty one first.
    * **Complete Profile Sync**: The "Replace" function now updates *everything* from the imported file‚Äîcolors, snippets, and the Dark/Light mode theme setting.
* **NEW - One-Click Restore**: A new **Restore (`history`) button** appears next to the default profiles. If you've modified a built-in theme, you can instantly revert it back to its original state, including any future default snippets.
* **Reliable Profile Snapshots**: Safely experiment with your colors! The **Pin** button now saves a complete snapshot of your profile (colors, CSS, and snippets). When you rename a profile, its snapshot is intelligently renamed with it.
* **Multi-Step Color Undo**: The "Undo" button (`reset` icon) remembers the last 5 changes you made to each color.
* **Profile-Specific Themes**: Force Obsidian into **Dark Mode** or **Light Mode** automatically when you activate a specific profile.

####  workflow & UI
* **Full CSS Editing**: Create and **edit** your CSS-based profiles and snippets at any time.
* **Smart Search UI**: A powerful search bar to filter colors and snippets, with toggles for case-sensitivity and Regular Expressions.
* **NEW - Eraser Tool**: A handy **Eraser (`eraser`) button** has been added to every color picker to instantly set any color to `transparent`.
* **Workflow Hotkeys**: Assign hotkeys to toggle the plugin on/off or instantly cycle to your next profile.
* **Performance Control (FPS Slider)**: Adjust the live preview frame rate to ensure a smooth experience.
* **Plugin Integrations**: Full color control for the **Iconize** plugin, with an automated cleanup system.
