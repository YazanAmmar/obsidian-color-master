## Color Variable Reference

For advanced users who want to know exactly what they're changing, here is a complete list of the CSS variables controlled by this plugin and their descriptions.

<details>
<summary><strong>ðŸŽ¨ Click to expand the full list of variables</strong></summary>

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| **Iconize Plugin** | |
| `--iconize-icon-color` | Sets the color for all icons added by the Iconize plugin, overriding its native color settings for a unified look.

This entire feature is controlled by the **"Override Iconize Plugin Colors"** toggle in the settings. This override is completely non-destructive:
- When turned **ON**, Color Master applies this custom color to the icons.
- When turned **OFF**, Color Master stops managing the colors, and your original settings from the Iconize plugin are instantly restored without any permanent changes to your configuration. |
| **Backgrounds** | |
| `--background-primary` | Main background color for the entire app, especially for editor and note panes. |
| `--background-primary-alt` | An alternate background color, often used for the active line in the editor. |

| `--text-normal` | The default text color for all notes and most of the UI. |
| `--text-muted` | A slightly faded text color, used for less important information like file metadata. |
