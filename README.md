## Overview

Color Master is an Obsidian plugin that allows you to edit and manage _all_ of Obsidian’s core CSS color variables using an interactive UI. Create theme **profiles** (bundles of colors, snippets, notice rules, and settings), switch between them instantly, export/share them as JSON, or even import CSS from your installed themes to create new, editable profiles.

Designed for both:

- **Beginners** — Simple color pickers, preset profiles, and a "Set Background" feature to get a polished look fast.
- **Power users / Developers** — Full variable list, per-profile & global snippets, drag-and-drop reordering, regex notice rules, and exportable JSON.

> The entire plugin is built on TypeScript, ensuring a stable, bug-free experience and faster future updates.

---

## Why Color Master?

- **Centralize Control:** Unify theme tweaks into **Profiles** (collections of variables + snippets + backgrounds).
- **No More CSS Sprawl:** Keep small CSS hacks tied to specific profiles instead of managing dozens of separate `.css` files.
- **Shareable Themes:** Create shareable theme packages (profiles export to a single `.json` file).
- **Automate Your Workspace:**
    - Force Dark/Light mode automatically per profile.
    - Apply custom video or image backgrounds per profile.
- **Intelligent & Dynamic:**
    - Style notice boxes by content (keyword / regex).
    - Get warned if an external theme might be interfering with your profile.
- **Performance Tuned:** Use the Live Preview FPS slider to balance visual feedback with CPU usage on your machine.

---

## Features

### 1. Core Profile Management

- **Live Color Editor**: An intuitive UI with color pickers and text inputs for over 60 core Obsidian variables.
- **Full Profile Management**: Create, delete, rename, and switch between multiple color profiles.
- **Import / Export**:
    - **Export to JSON**: Save your complete profile (colors, snippets, rules, background path) to a single `.json` file.
    - **Import from JSON**: Import a profile JSON. The UI lets you choose a new name, preventing accidental overwrites.
- **Beautiful Default Themes**: Comes with 5 stunning, ready-to-use profiles to get you started.

### 2. Advanced Customization

- **NEW - Per-Profile Backgrounds (Image & Video!)** [v1.1.1]:
    - Set a custom **image or video** background for each profile.
    - Built-in **Background Browser** to manage all your media: select, rename, and safely delete.
    - Easily add new media via file upload, drag & drop, or pasting a URL.
    - Automatically applies necessary transparency to UI elements for you.
    - Dedicated settings for **video (opacity, mute)** and **images (JPG conversion/quality)**.
- **Import from Installed Themes**:
    - Instantly create a new, editable CSS-based profile by importing the code from your already-installed community themes or snippets.
- **Advanced Notice Coloring**:
    - Control the background and text color of pop-up notices based on their content (keywords or Regex).
    - Rules are saved **per-profile** and are included in exports.
- **CSS Snippets (Profile & Global)**:
    - **Per-Profile Snippets**: Attach CSS snippets that are *only* active when their profile is active. Included in exports.
    - **Global Snippets**: Create snippets that stay active across *all* of your profiles, perfect for a custom font or a small, universal UI tweak.
    - **Drag & Drop**: Easily reorder your snippets with drag & drop to manage CSS priority (cascade).

### 3. Workflow & UI

- **NEW - Quick Theme Toggle**: Instantly cycle the active profile's theme setting between "Force Light," "Force Dark," and "Auto" with a new icon in the profile manager.
- **NEW - Ribbon Icon**: Access the Color Master settings with a single click from the Obsidian ribbon.
- **NEW - Reset Plugin**: A safe "Reset All Data" button in the advanced settings to restore the plugin to its factory state.
- **NEW - Theme Interference Warning**: A small ⚠️ icon appears if you have a community theme enabled, warning you that it might override your Color Master settings.
- **Add Custom CSS Variables**:
    - Add any CSS variable (e.g., from another plugin) to the UI.
    - Define its type (color, size, text, number) for the correct UI controls.
    - Custom variables are saved and exported with your profile.
- **Reliable Profile Snapshots**: Use the **Pin** button to save a complete snapshot of your profile (colors, CSS, snippets, rules). Experiment freely and restore with one click.
- **Multi-Step Color Undo**: The "Undo" icon (`reset`) remembers the last 5 changes you made to each specific color.
- **Plugin Integrations**: Full color control for the **Iconize** plugin, with an automated cleanup system.
- **Bilingual & RTL Ready**: Full support for English, Arabic, French, and Persian, with a robust architecture for Right-to-Left (RTL) layouts.

## Building from Source (Developer)

If you want to customize the plugin or contribute to its development, you can easily build it from the source code.

1. **Clone the Repository:**
    
    
    
```Bash
git clone https://github.com/YazanAmmar/obsidian-color-master.git
cd obsidian-color-master
```
    
2. Install Dependencies:
    
    Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then, run the following command.
    
    ```Bash
    npm install
    ```
    
3. **Build the Plugin:** To compile the TypeScript code and package the plugin for Obsidian:
    
    - **Standard Build:** Use `npm run build` to compile the core files (`main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json`) into the project root.
        
        ```Bash
        npm run build
        ```
        
    - **Development Build (Advanced):** Use `npm run dev` to **compile AND automatically copy** the resulting files to a local Obsidian vault.
        
        ```Bash
        npm run dev
        ```
        
> [!NOTE]
> 
> The npm run dev command is currently configured with a personal path:
> 
> C:\Users\user\Documents\Obsidian\My Notes\.obsidian\plugins\obsidian-color-master
> 
> You must edit the dev script inside the package.json file to point to your local vault's plugin folder before running this command.
        
4. Load into Obsidian: The compiled files (main.js, styles.css, manifest.json) will be in the project's root. Copy these files into your vault's plugin folder:
    
```bash
    <YourVault>/.obsidian/plugins/color-master/
```

## Usage Guide & Examples

### 1. Profiles: Create, Import, Export

A **Profile** is a single "theme" that saves all your settings.

- **Create**: Go to `Profile Manager` -> `New`. Give it a name and choose if it should force "Dark", "Light" mode or "Auto".
    
- **Export**: Select the profile you want to share, then click `Export File`. This saves a single `.json` file with all colors, snippets, and rules.
    
- **Import**: Click `Import / Paste (.json)`. You can paste the JSON text or upload the file. You will be prompted to give it a new name.
    
### 2. Setting a Custom Background (Image/Video)

This is one of the most popular features [from v1.1.0].

1. Go to `Advanced Settings` -> `Set Custom Background`.
    
2. Click the `+` (Add) button. A modal will open.
    
3. **Drag & drop** an image or video, **upload** a file, or **paste a URL**.
    
4. The plugin will save the media and activate it.
    
5. Click the `📦` (Browse) button to see all your saved media, rename them, or select a different one.
    
6. Click the `⚙️` (Settings) button to control video opacity, mute, or image quality.
    

### 3. Using CSS Snippets (Profile & Global)

You can add small CSS tweaks without creating separate files.

- **Profile Snippets**: Created normally. They are tied to the active profile and are exported with it.
    
- **Global Snippets**: When creating/editing a snippet, check the "Save as Global Snippet" toggle. This snippet will remain active _no matter which profile you switch to_.
    
- **Order**: You can **drag and drop** snippets in the list to control their load order (snippets lower in the list can override ones above them).
    

### 4. Advanced Notice Coloring (Keywords & Regex)

Customize the color of pop-up notices based on their text content.

1. Find the `Notices` category in the color pickers.
    
2. Click the `⚙️` (Settings) icon next to `--cm-notice-bg-default` (for background) or `--cm-notice-text-default` (for text).
    
3. In the modal, click `Add New Rule`.
    
4. **Keywords**: Type keywords (e.g., "Success", "Saved") into the box and press `Space` or `Enter`.
    
5. **Regex**: Or, type a regular expression (e.g., `\bError\b`) and check the "Regex" box.
    
6. Choose a color for that rule.
    
7. You can drag and drop rules to change their priority. The first rule that matches (from top to bottom) will be applied.
    

---

## Hotkeys (Commands)

You can assign hotkeys to these commands in `Settings` -> `Hotkeys`:

- **Enable & Disable**: Toggle the entire plugin on or off.
    
- **Cycle to next profile**: Instantly switch to the next profile in your list.
    
- **Cycle to previous profile**: Switch to the previous profile.
    
- **Open settings tab**: Open the Color Master settings panel.
    
- **Cycle active profile theme**: Cycle the active profile's theme (Light/Dark/Auto).
    

---

## Performance & Tips

-   If you notice lag while dragging a color picker, reduce the **Live Update FPS** slider in the `Advanced Settings` section. A value of 0 disables live preview completely, applying color only when you release the mouse.
	
-   The **Theme Interference Warning** ⚠️ is important. If you have a community theme (e.g., "Minimal") enabled *and* a Color Master profile active, they might fight over colors. For best results, set your Obsidian theme to "Default" and let Color Master handle all the colors.
	
-   **For Optimal Performance:** We recommend enabling the **Convert images to JPG** option in the Background Settings. This automatically compresses uploaded images, resulting in smaller file sizes and better loading performance without noticeable loss of visual quality.
	
-   **If you encounter stability or performance issues:** First, export your current profiles and backgrounds. Then, use the **Reset Plugin Settings** option in Advanced Settings to restore the plugin to its factory state. This often solves underlying data conflicts.

## Troubleshooting / FAQ

### Q: ⚠️ Why are my colors not changing after I activate a profile?

A: This is the most common issue. You likely have a **Community Theme** (like Minimal, Atom, etc.) enabled simultaneously. This external theme imposes its own color rules and interferes with the variables set by **Color Master**.

**The Best Solution:**

1. Go to Obsidian's **Settings** -> **Appearance** -> **Themes**.
    
2. Select the **Default** theme for Obsidian.
    
3. The ⚠️ warning icon in Color Master settings will disappear, and your profile's colors will apply correctly.
    

**Advanced Solution (To customize an external theme):**

1. Set Obsidian's theme to **Default**.
    
2. Open **Color Master** settings and click **Import / Paste (.css)**.
    
3. Select the **"Import from installed theme"** option and choose the theme you want to modify (e.g., Minimal).
    
4. This creates a **new CSS Profile** within Color Master containing the external theme's code, allowing you to customize its colors safely without conflicts.
    

---

### Q: I added an image or video background, but the UI (like sidebars) is still dark. Why isn't it transparent?

A: **Color Master** uses **Smart Transparency** to handle this.

- When you activate a background, the plugin automatically sets key CSS variables (like `--background-primary` and `--sidebar-background`) to `transparent`.
    
- This makes the UI layers see-through, allowing your image or video to be visible.
    

---

### Q: What is the difference between a normal Snippet and a Global Snippet?

A: The core difference is scope:

- **Profile Snippet (Normal):** Is linked to a **single profile**. It only activates when that specific profile is active, and it is included when you export the profile.

>Use **Profile Snippets** for things that only make sense with that profile, like a special `h1` color.

- **Global Snippet:** **Always** remains active, regardless of which profile is currently selected. This is ideal for universal styles you always need, like a custom font or hiding a specific UI element.

>Use **Global Snippets** for things you _always_ want, like a custom font.

---

### Q: What are Snapshots (Pin) and why should I use them?

A: Snapshots are a safety feature.

- The **Pin** button saves an **instant snapshot** of the profile's current state (colors, CSS, and notice rules).
    
- If you make changes you don't like, the **Reset to Pinned** button instantly reverts the profile to the saved snapshot, allowing for risk-free experimentation.
    

---

### Q: 🌍 Does the plugin support Right-to-Left (RTL) languages?

A: Yes, absolutely. The plugin fully supports **Arabic** (العَرَبيَّةُ) and **Persian** (فارسی). You can find the **Enable Right-to-Left (RTL) Layout** setting near the language dropdown to flip the interface completely for a seamless reading experience.
