## ‚ú® Features

Color Master is packed with features designed for both beginners and power-users, giving you ultimate control over your workspace's appearance.

#### üèõÔ∏è Foundational Features
* **Live Color Editor**: An intuitive UI with color pickers and text inputs to see your changes instantly.
* **Full Profile Management**: Create, delete, and switch between multiple color profiles. Each profile is a self-contained unit that holds its own colors, snippets, notice rules, and theme settings.
* **Bilingual & RTL Ready**: Full support for English and Arabic (ÿßŸÑÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿäÿ©), with a foundational architecture built to handle Right-to-Left layouts perfectly.
* **Beautiful Default Themes**: Comes with five stunning, ready-to-use profiles to get you started.

#### üöÄ Power-User Tools
* **NEW - Advanced Notice Coloring**: A revolutionary system to control the background and text color of pop-up notices based on their content (keywords or Regex). These rules are now saved **per-profile** and are included in exports!
* **Per-Profile CSS Snippets**: Snippets are no longer global and are now saved directly to the active profile. This means your small CSS tweaks are perfectly organized and are **exported automatically** with your theme.
* **Powerful Import/Export**:
    * **Create New Profile from JSON**: Easily import a `.json` file to create a brand new profile instantly.
    * **Smarter Import**: If you import a profile with a name that already exists, a new dialog will prompt you for a different name, preventing accidental overwrites.
* **Reliable Profile Snapshots**: Safely experiment with your colors! The **Pin** button now saves a complete snapshot of your profile, including **colors, CSS, snippets, and notice rules**.
* **Multi-Step Color Undo**: The "Undo" button (`reset` icon) remembers the last 5 changes you made to each color.
* **Profile-Specific Themes**: Force Obsidian into **Dark Mode** or **Light Mode** automatically when you activate a specific profile.

#### workflow & UI
* **NEW - Deep Search & Highlighting**: The search bar is now more powerful than ever, searching through variable **descriptions** (not just names) and highlighting matches with a beautiful animated gradient.
* **Full CSS Editing**: Create and **edit** your CSS-based profiles and snippets at any time.
* **Eraser Tool**: A handy **Eraser (`eraser`) button** has been added to every color picker to instantly set any color to `transparent`.
* **Workflow Hotkeys**: Assign hotkeys to toggle the plugin on/off or instantly cycle to your next profile.
* **Performance Control (FPS Slider)**: Adjust the live preview frame rate to ensure a smooth experience.
* **Plugin Integrations**: Full color control for the **Iconize** plugin, with an automated cleanup system.
